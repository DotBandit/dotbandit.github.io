				  	<h3>DotBandit - Getting Started</h3>
				  	<p class="a">Starting off with DotBandit is pretty easy. The Builder's tab contains the Main program's function. Your executable file will be built here. Edit the default configurations to your choice. When you've finished editing the options to your liking, you may proceed to build the executable file. On the bottom right corner, click 'Generate Executable'. Or go up to File > Generate Executable. Save it to your chosen path. Then click save. The application will be compiled and when successful can be deployed anywhere.</p>

				  	<h3>DotBandit - Archive</h3>
				  	<p class="a">Once you have run the executable file, depending on the settings, DotBandit will always save its Log Reports/Screenshots in the 'C: > Users > USERNAME > AppData > Roaming' Folder. Head over to the Archive's tab and right anywhere on the white space, then click 'Open Folder...'. This will lead you to the AppData's Roaming Folder. If you have already run an executable, the Archive tab will list the files in the Roaming directory. Right click on the selected item, and you may 'Open Folder..', 'Open File' or 'Delete' the selected file.</p>
